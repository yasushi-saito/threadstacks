// An UnbufferedChannel is used to facilitate a handshake between a writer and a
// reader. A writer blocks until there is a reader ready for the handshake.
// Similarly, a reader of an UnbufferedChannel blocks until there is a writer
// ready for the handshake. An UnbufferedChannel can be thought of as a buffered
// channel with 0 capacity.
//
// Algorithm for Write() (sans timeouts and channel closing):
// 1. Wait until there is no writer is handshake zone already.
// 2. Enter the handshake zone and mark that a writer is in handshake zone.
// 3. Write the value.
// 4. Notify one reader to enter handshake zone.
// 5. Wait for reader to enter the zone and consume the value.
// 6. Mark that no writer and no reader (reader is guaranteed to have left the
//    zone) is in handshake zone.
// 7. Notify one of the existing writers to enter the zone.
//
// Algorithm for Read() (sans timeouts and channel closing):
// 1. Wait until there is one writer, but no reader, is in handshake zone.
// 2. Enter the handshake zone and mark that a reader is in handshake zone.
// 3. Read the value.
// 4. Notify the writer (which is guaranteed to be waiting for the reader) that
//    reader entered the zone and consumed the value.
